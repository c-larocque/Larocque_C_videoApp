# VideoApp

This is just a quick app to allow users to check out what ever movie trailers and info on the site.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

After cloning the master branch to your computer, navigate to the root folder through the terminal and run npm install. This will ensure the Video App's main functionality is working properly. To get the videos to work, place the zipped 'video' folder within the public folder. Make sure you are connected to the proper database in the config.js file, and have that same data in your phpmyadmin.

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

To make any changes using SASS, navigate to the root folder in terminal and run ``grunt watch``. This will active SASS and allow you to make any styling changes necessary.


## Deployment

To run this video app on your local browser, after completing the above installation steps, navigate to the project folder using terminal and run ``npm start``. With the server running, go to your preferred browser and type 'localhost:3000' to view the application.
